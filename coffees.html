    <p>roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted.[89] The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing
        the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume,
        causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements
        for packaging. The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches approximately 200 °C (392 °F),
        though different varieties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates.[90] During
        roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches, changing them to simple sugars that begin to brown,
        which alters the color of the bean.</p>

    <p>[91] Sucrose is rapidly lost during the roasting process, and may disappear entirely
        in darker roasts. During roasting, aromatic oils and acids weaken, changing the flavor; at 205 °C (401 °F), other oils
        start to develop.[90] One of these oils, caffeol, is created at about 200 °C (392 °F), which is largely responsible for
        coffee's aroma and flavor.[25] Roasting is the last step of processing the beans in their intact state. During this last
        treatment, while still in the bean state, more caffeine breaks down above 235 °C (455 °F). Dark roasting is the utmost
        step in bean processing removing the most caffeine. Although, dark roasting is not to be confused with the Decaffeination
        process.</p>
